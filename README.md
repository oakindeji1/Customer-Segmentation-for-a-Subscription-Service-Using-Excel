# Customer-Segmentation-for-a-Subscription-Service-Using-Excel
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify  segments and trends. My goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types,  and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals.

## The dataset has the following structure:

### CustomerData
       - CustomerID: Unique identifier for customers.
       - CustomerName: Names of the customers.
       - Region: Geographic region of the customers.
       - SubscriptionType: Type of subscription (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium).
       - SubscriptionStart and SubscriptionEnd: Dates of subscription activity.
       - Canceled: Boolean indicating whether the subscription was canceled.
       - Revenue: Revenue generated from the customer.

### Next Steps:
CustomerData Analysis:

- Identify revenue trends by region and subscription type.
